Designed a Discord bot to play a unique theme song on
YouTube for each user when they enter a voice channel.

The bot was built using the

Hosted application on Heroku using a MongoDB database.

<br />

Utilized asynchronous programming to handle user commands and events at scale to over 1200 users.
