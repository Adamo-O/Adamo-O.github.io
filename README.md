## Design 🖌
This website's goal is to allow for a more interactive and visual presentation of my projects and experience. 

To keep the focus on the content, a simple and clean design was chosen.

### Colour 🎨
On a material dark grey background, colours were specifically chosen to allow for sufficient contrast according to material UI standards. A blue/purple accent colour (#7690d6) was chosen for its contrast and for being a calming, simple colour. Otherwise, standard text colour was used since it had sufficient contrast and readability.

### Layout 📏
The three-column layout seen on larger screens was built using Bootstrap to allow for a lightweight grid system. It was also chosen to have consistency when scrolling through the website, with the first column being the section name, the second column being the content, and the third column being the project name.

## Content 📜
The Projects and Experience sections have brief descriptions of each of their items. This consists of 5-6 sentences describing the item, goal, and method of working on the project. 

Each Project or Experience item has a GIF or image showcasing it. GIFs allowed for 15-second videos that are very lightweight on the website, and will keep the attention of the viewer. It is the perfect way to introduce an item quickly.

The skills subsection lists any programming languages, technical skills, and/or soft skills used in the project or work experience. This makes it easy to quickly screen the skills obtained throughout my career.
