Developed hierarchy graph web component as part of a new
company initiative. My work confirmed that this initiative
was desirable by our team, and they continued development
of the project as a result.

<br />

Built the web component using Polymer.js, featuring an
interactive collapsible tree graph using D3.js. This graph
was used to visualize relationships between dependencies
in a core application.

<br />

Documented project work as reference for future web
component development. Presented the documentation and
demoed the development experience of the project to the
Montreal office.

<br />

Collaborated in a scrum team with daily meetings for task
grooming and allocation. Represented the interns in
meetings on multiple occaisons.
