subtitle: RESEARCH
---
An automated method of obtaining graphs of letters or
numbers using accelerometers.

<br />

This research was done under the mentorship of Professor
Larnder at John Abbott College and was done alongside
another research assistant, Justin Cardona.

<br />

We created a method of converting raw acceleration data
into position data, which can be visualized on a scatter
plot to obtain the written letter, using Python scripts.
