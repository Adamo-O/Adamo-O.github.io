An Arduino robot built to traverse a random obstacle
course.

<br />

In a team of 4, we used an ultrasonic sensor, a servo, 4
motors, and recyclable materials as the body of the robot,
to avoid obstacles in a random obstacle course.

My contributions to the team were managing the team's tasks
and programming the robot's obstacle-avoiding logic in
C++.

<br />

The goal of this challenge was to avoid touching any
obstacles in the alloted 2-minute time frame. 

Our team succeeded, allowing us to win first place in the class. üèÜ
