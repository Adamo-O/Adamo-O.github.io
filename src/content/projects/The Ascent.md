The Ascent is an upwards 2D platformer created using C# in
Unity.

<br />

This project was completed as part of the International
Baccalaureate (IB) Personal Project in high school.

Students had to complete a project on a topic they were
interested in. Having a basic introduction to programming,
I used this as an opportunity to learn more while putting
my skills to use.

All assets, including music and art, were made by me.
